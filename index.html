                        The Admin. Code contains roughly 118,000 restrictions and 9.3 million words. It would take an individual 
                        518 hours, or almost 13 weeks, to read the Admin. Code from beginning to end.</p>

This goes hand in hand with the Secretary of State's Tackle the Tape initiative. For too long, state agencies have made rules that made it difficult for people to work in Mississippi because they did not want the competition moving in.

We have a wonderful state, and I want to join Secretary Michael Watson in his efforts of tackling the tape across the Magnolia state!”</p>
